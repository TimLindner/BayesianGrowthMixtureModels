### Introduction
Hi there :sunglasses: My name is Tim, and this repository contains my work on Bayesian growth mixture models ( or GMMs for short ), including their application to country-level terrorism data. The work has been developed in coorporation with Dr. Nalan Basturk as part of my research assistantance in econometrics at Maastricht University.

### Work developed
* The models have been implemented and estimated using the Stan probabilistic programming language and its built-in No-U-Turn Sampler ( or NUTS for short ) via the RStan R package (Stan Development Team, 2024).
* Work in progress

### Repository structure
