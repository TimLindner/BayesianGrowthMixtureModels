### Introduction
Hi there :sunglasses: My name is Tim, and this repository contains my work on Bayesian growth mixture models (or GMMs for short) including hidden Markov chains and softmax regressions for representing latent class memberships. The work has been developed in cooperation with Dr. Nalan Basturk as part of my research assistantance in econometrics at Maastricht University.

### Work developed

### Statistical computation
* The GMMs have been implemented and estimated using Stan and the No-U-Turn Sampler (or NUTS for short) via RStan — the R interface to Stan (Stan Development Team, n.d.; Stan Development Team, 2024)
* The R Stats Package has been used to perform K-means clustering in the context of prior elicitation (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2022)
