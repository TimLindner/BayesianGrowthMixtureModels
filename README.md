### Introduction
Hi there :sunglasses: My name is Tim, and this repository contains my work on Bayesian growth mixture models ( or GMMs for short ), including their application to country-level terrorism data. The work has been developed in cooperation with Dr. Nalan Basturk as part of my research assistantance in econometrics at Maastricht University.

### Work developed
* Placeholder

### Statistical computing
* The models have been implemented and estimated using Stan and its built-in No-U-Turn Sampler ( or NUTS for short ) via RStan — the R interface to Stan (Stan Development Team, n.d.; Stan Development Team, 2024)
* The R Stats Package has been used to perform K-means clustering in the context of prior elicitation (R Core Team and contributors worldwide, 2022)
